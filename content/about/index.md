The Python Corner was born in 2016. 

I was working on a log analyzer for Windows when I discovered that the `open` Python statement on Windows behave 
differently than it does on Linux because on Windows it actually locks the opened file. It seemed strange to me and I decided to write a post about that on my [Medium](https://medium.com) publication.

I started to receive a lot of comments of people thanking me for the article and I decided that I would have posted something else if I would have had another nice tip to share and a couple of weeks later I had the need to automate a simple web navigation with Python. This gave me the idea for my second post and I collected even more visualization and comments than the first one.  

This started everything.  


a project born in 2016 with


If you are reading this page it means that you are interested in this project, so the first thing I want to tell you is **THANK YOU!**

Staying online and creating quality content costs real money. I personally invest all my knowledge, my passion and a lot of my time in this project and so **I need your help**.

The less you can do to support this site is to let the world knows this site exists.
At the end of each article you will find some social media buttons to share the article on Twitter, Linkedin or Facebook. Please, a single click doesn't cost anthing to you but can do a lot of difference for me.

But you can do even more to support The Python Corner: **you can donate**.

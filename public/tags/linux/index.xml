      <description>We ran into a problem last week. Our web application produces a lot of documents that have to be accessed frequently for a couple of months after they&amp;rsquo;re created. However, in less than a year these documents will be almost never accessed anymore, but we need to keep them available for the web application and for tons of other legacy apps that might need to access them.
Now, these documents take a lot of space on our expensive but super fast storage system (let&amp;rsquo;s call it primary storage system or PSS from now on) and we would like to be able to move them on the cheaper, not so good and yet quite slow storage system (that we&amp;rsquo;re going to call secondary storage system or SSS) when we believe that they will not be accessed anymore.</description>

      <description>I was relaxing on a beach during my summer leave when I received a mail from a reader that asked me if it is technically possible to write a virus using Python.
The short answer: YES.
The longer answer: yes, BUT&amp;hellip;
Let&amp;rsquo;s start by saying that viruses are a little bit anachronistic in 2021&amp;hellip; nowadays other kinds of malware (like worms for example) are far more common than viruses. Moreover, modern operative systems are more secure and less prone to be infected than MS-DOS or Windows 95 were (sorry Microsoft&amp;hellip;) and people are more aware of the risk of malware in general.</description>

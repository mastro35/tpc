A lot of people don&amp;rsquo;t care at all about logging the execution of their programs and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of code released in the production environment that doesn&amp;rsquo;t log anything. To log seems to be a waste of time to them, especially if the code they&amp;rsquo;re writing is apparently simple. So, why bother logging the execution of a program if the program can run great with no logs?</description></item></channel></rss>

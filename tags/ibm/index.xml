For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s a mainframe, kiddo&amp;rdquo;!
However, even if I do know what a mainframe is, when I looked at the input files I was having to work with, I was like&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;oh my gosh, what is this stuff?!?!&amp;rdquo;
It took me a while to understand that what I was seeing wasn&amp;rsquo;t a set of standard ASCII files but a set of weird EBCDIC files.</description></item></channel></rss>

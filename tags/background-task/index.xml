Have you ever had the need of writing a Python script that could run in background as a Windows Service? In this post, you will learn how to do it in less than 10 minutes, no jokes.
I will skip all the introduction about Windows Services, how convenient they could be, how much could be appreciated the fact that they can be run in background even when the user is logged off etc&amp;hellip; I mean, if you can code in Python and you use Windows I bet you already know what a Windows Service is, don&amp;rsquo;t you?</description></item></channel></rss>
